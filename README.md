## ❓ What is a rice?

> Ricing refers to the process of customizing the visual appearance and functionality of a desktop environment, usually in Linux or Unix-based systems.<br />
It involves tweaking themes, icons, fonts, and configurations to achieve a unique and aesthetically pleasing interface.<br />
A well-customized setup, called a "rice", showcases the user's attention to detail, personality and creativity.

Take a look at [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) for inspiration.


## 🤔 What does PimpMyRice do?

PimpMyRice allows you to generate, organize and apply [themes](https://pimpmyrice.vercel.app/docs/theme) to your system.<br />
It applies them through [modules](https://pimpmyrice.vercel.app/docs/module), each module being responsible for styling a specific program (eg: [discord](https://github.com/pimpmyrice-modules/betterdiscord)).
